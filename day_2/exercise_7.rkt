Exercise 7. Develop the macro and/v, which is like and except that it binds the result of its first expression to a variable written => identifier. For example,
(and/v 1 => x (+ x 1))

evaluates to 2, but
(and/v #f => x (+ x 1))

evaluates to #f. You can use #:literals in syntax-parse, since => is already bound (assuming you think that bindingâ€™s reuse is appropriate).
After getting and/v to work, make the => identifier part optional. Note that both => and identifier must be both omitted or both present. image
